Purpose:
At the Virtual Reality Science Club, the purpose is to foster innovation, curiosity, and enhanced learning experiences through the development and integration of augmented reality science modules into the existing curriculum. We aim to create an engaging and immersive environment where students can explore scientific concepts, conduct experiments, and visualize abstract theories through the power of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies.

Our primary goal is to bridge the gap between traditional classroom teaching and cutting-edge technology by leveraging VR and AR to revolutionize the way students perceive and comprehend scientific subjects. By utilizing interactive simulations, virtual laboratories, and 3D models, we intend to provide students with captivating and dynamic learning opportunities that promote deeper understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Students will be able to take ownership of their own education and co-create their learning with teachers. 

Through collaborative projects, hands-on experimentation, and teamwork, the club members will have the chance to develop their creativity and technical proficiency while making valuable contributions to the education community. I believe that by empowering students to create and refine their own augmented reality science modules, we can inspire a passion for scientific exploration and ignite a lifelong love for learning.

The virtual reality science club strives to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape, preparing them for future careers and fostering their overall personal and academic growth. By embracing the potential of augmented reality in science education, we aim to empower the next generation of innovators, problem-solvers, and leaders!

Internally
I believe in the power of co-creating education. These students have the unique opportunity to actively shape  learning experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and agency in their educational journey. 
Through collaborative projects, discussions, and feedback loops, club members work together to design and develop augmented reality science modules that align with their interests, curiosities, and the needs of their peers. 
This co-creation process not only deepens their understanding of scientific concepts but also hones their critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.
Members of the club become inspiring mentors for younger learners. By utilizing the augmented reality science modules they have developed, club members create engaging and interactive lessons that capture the imagination of their younger peers. They encourage exploration, curiosity, and hands-on experimentation, fostering a love for science from an early age.
By empowering students to co-create their education and serve as teachers, we cultivate a culture of lifelong learning and leadership. Club members not only deepen their own understanding but also develop valuable teaching skills, empathy, and a sense of responsibility. 
They inspire younger students to embrace science as a thrilling adventure, nurturing the next generation of curious and enthusiastic learners who will continue the cycle of co-creation and knowledge sharing. 
Externally
Through various outreach initiatives, the goal is to empower and excite other students in the area about the wonders of science. 
Through interactive workshops, demonstrations, and presentations at neighboring schools, community events, and science fairs, where we will showcase the immersive and captivating possibilities of augmented reality in scientific exploration.
By engaging other student peers in hands-on activities and sharing knowledge, we hope to ignite a spark of curiosity and inspire a newfound excitement for scientific discovery.
Appearances at local science fairs, ASU events and parent/teacher conferences
Other Benefits
Your high school can be poised to be at the forefront of educating students on cutting-edge technology, revolutionizing the way students learn. 
With a focus on emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and other innovative tools, students get equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
Parents will be very happy students can engage in such activities
Very good for college applications, if the students build quality portfolios and wow college recruiters.

Frank’s Thoughts:
Reflecting on my experience in high school, much of my outlets in sports, academics were all framed as some type of competition. I felt like it set me up in a particularly toxic mindset entering college - how I had to compete to succeed in everything I did. Granted, now I’ve matured and grown past that - hopefully we can create an environment where the competitions aren’t such a prime focus and students can become empathetic leaders.
Focus on the joy of learning. Creating safe places to fail, and simply enjoying the process of creating for creating’s sake.

Omkar’s Suggestions:
It mostly looks great, but one issue I noticed is the timing. Pretty much all clubs run one day a week for 1.5 hours after school (the only exceptions being team competitions like basketball, esports, robotics, etc). I don't think there's a rule against it, but people might be reluctant to go/send their kids to the club if this is the case (also since it's a new club).
Original plan: After-school club 1.5 hours per day for 2 days. Issues covered above, but I think this would still be the easiest way. Change to an after school club for 1 day.
Alternative ways:
Wednesday Morning Enrichment: This is a single 3-hour block during school hours on Wednesdays where people can sign up for non-graded classes that are more like "workshops" (in the past this has included things like cooking, 3D printing, and theater tech). These run on a semester basis, and would mostly fit into your timeline, as well as only needing to sign "club advisor level" forms, as I understand it. Issues: might mess up your daily schedule, doesn't run on the last Wednesday of every month (as school starts late that day).
Elective Class: The final option I can think of is to directly offer the "VR Club Experience" as an elective course. This isn't impossible to do as a non-teacher; for example, my friend's dad is a volunteer and teaches the photography elective. This would probably be the most accessible to students, and allow you the most resources (probably, I'm not sure how admin sees it). Issues: The most intensive option for your schedule, probably need a lot more verification as a teacher than a club advisor, at least a few formal assignments/grades needed for students. I'd recommend this option the least.
